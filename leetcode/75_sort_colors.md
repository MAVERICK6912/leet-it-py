The Dutch National Flag algorithm is a sorting algorithm that separates an array of elements into three groups. It was originally designed to sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s, but can be extended to sort arrays with more than three distinct elements. The algorithm works by maintaining three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`. The `low` pointer points to the beginning of the array, the `mid` pointer scans the array from left to right, and the `high` pointer points to the end of the array. The algorithm partitions the array into four regions:

1. Elements less than the pivot (0) are in the range `[low, mid-1]`.
2. Elements equal to the pivot are in the range `[mid, high]`.
3. Elements greater than the pivot (2) are in the range `[high+1, n-1]`.
4. Elements in the range `[mid, high-1]` are unexplored.

The algorithm works by swapping elements between the regions until all elements are in their correct region. Here is an example implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```python
def dutch_national_flag(arr):
    low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(arr) - 1

    while mid <= high:
        if arr[mid] == 0:
            arr[low], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif arr[mid] == 1:
            mid += 1
        else:
            arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]
            high -= 1

    return arr
```

Let's do a dry run of this algorithm on the input array `[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]`:

1. `low`, `mid`, and `high` are all initialized to 0, so the initial state of the array is `[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]`.
2. `arr[mid]` is 2, so we swap it with `arr[high]` and decrement `high`. The array is now `[2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`.
3. `arr[mid]` is 0, so we swap it with `arr[low]` and increment both `low` and `mid`. The array is now `[0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]`.
4. `arr[mid]` is 2, so we swap it with `arr[high]` and decrement `high`. The array is now `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.
5. `arr[mid]` is 1, so we simply increment `mid`. The array is still `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.
6. `arr[mid]` is 1, so we simply increment `mid`. The array is still `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.
7. The algorithm has finished, and the sorted array is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.

I hope this helps!

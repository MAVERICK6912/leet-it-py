Moore's voting algorithm is a linear time algorithm used to find the majority element in an array. The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than `n/2` times in an array of length `n`. The algorithm works by maintaining a candidate element and a count variable. Initially, the candidate element is set to the first element of the array, and the count is set to 1. Then, for each subsequent element in the array, if the element is the same as the candidate element, the count is incremented. Otherwise, the count is decremented. If the count ever becomes 0, the candidate element is updated to the current element, and the count is reset to 1. After iterating through the entire array, the candidate element is the majority element if it appears more than `n/2` times.

Here is an example implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```python
def majority_element(arr):
    candidate = None
    count = 0

    for elem in arr:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = elem
            count = 1
        elif elem == candidate:
            count += 1
        else:
            count -= 1

    # Verify that the candidate element is the majority element
    count = 0
    for elem in arr:
        if elem == candidate:
            count += 1

    if count > len(arr) // 2:
        return candidate
    else:
        return None
```

Let's do a dry run of this algorithm on the input array `[2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]`:

1. `candidate` is initially set to `2`, and `count` is set to `1`.
2. The next element is also `2`, so `count` is incremented to `2`.
3. The next element is `3`, so `count` is decremented to `1`.
4. The next element is `2`, so `count` is incremented to `2`.
5. The next element is `4`, so `count` is decremented to `1`.
6. The next element is `2`, so `count` is incremented to `2`.
7. The final element is `5`, so `count` is decremented to `1`.
8. The candidate element is `2`, which appears 3 times in the array. Since 3 is greater than `len(arr) // 2`, `2` is the majority element.

I hope this helps!
